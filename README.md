# Artilico
Artistic live-coding in Common Lisp. Why artistic? Oh..

## Watch your fingers!
This thing inspired by [fluxus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxus_(programming_environment)). It gently catch your mistakes and let you fly with wings of Lisp. No more stupid crashes. Baa..

## Controls
It is pretty similar to all you like text editors, except:

```ctrl + Enter``` Evaluate code

## Future
* Better code-editor (optimizations, paredit, autocomplete, colors)
* Artist friendly mechanics
* Sound coding (cl-patterns)
* Use GPU-buffers for fast and glory

## Maybe
* Graphical tablet input
